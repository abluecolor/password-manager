# password-manager

A simple password manager project, "password-manager," with two modes: adding new passwords and viewing saved passwords. The password manager utilizes the Fernet encryption algorithm from the cryptography library to ensure password confidentiality.

## lessons learned

* Secure password management practices
* Encryption with Fernet
* Handling user input securely
* Error handling and exception management
* Encoding and decoding bytes

## challenges
This password manager is a simple project and lacks advanced security features such as a master password. To further improve it, I would learn more about Fernet to implement a master password, and research file types that should not be tracked with Git for security purposes. This app is not intended for storing highly sensitive information. I would only use it for educational purposes and as a starting point for building more robust password management systems.
