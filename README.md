# password-manager

A simple password manager project, "password-manager," with two modes: adding new passwords and viewing saved passwords. The password manager utilizes the Fernet encryption algorithm from the cryptography library to ensure password confidentiality.

## lessons learned

* Secure password management practices
* Encryption with Fernet
* Handling user input securely
* Error handling and exception management
* Command-line interface (CLI) development

## challenges
This password manager is a simple project and lacks advanced security features such as a master password. It is not intended for storing highly sensitive information. I would only use it for educational purposes and as a starting point for building more robust password management systems.
